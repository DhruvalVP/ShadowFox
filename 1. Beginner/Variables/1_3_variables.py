# Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3 years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100

P = 10000    # principal_amount = 10000
R = 15   # rate_of_interest = 15
T = 3    # time = 3 years

simple_interest = (P*R*T)/100   # Calculate Simple Interest

print(f"Simple Interest is {simple_interest}")
